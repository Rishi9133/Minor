# Message Body

## Key-Value Pairs

Each IOTMP message consists basically on a series of `key-value` pairs. When a message is encoded, the keys and values are concatenated into a byte stream. When the message is decoded, the parser needs to be able to skip fields that it doesn't recognize. This way, new fields can be added to a message without breaking old programs that do not know about them. To this end, the "key" for each pair in a wire-format message is actually two values â€“ the field number according to each message definition, plus a [Wire-Type](message-body.md#wire-type), that provides just enough information to find the length of the following value.

So, the message body is composed of a variable number of fields, each one with a key-value pair:

| Field     | Type                               | Description                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key**   | [varint](../definitions.md#varint) | Specifies the field identifier and the value type. |
| **Value** | [any](../definitions.md#any)       | Contains the actual payload of the field.          |

## Key

Each key in the message is a [varint](../definitions.md#varint) that encodes both the field identifier, and the value type. The value type is called the wire type, and specifies how the value is encoded over the wire. Field identifier represents just the field for each specific message, i.e., if the value is related with a stream identifier, a payload, a parameter, etc.

Each key is then a [varint](../definitions.md#varint), where the first 3 bits indicates the [Wire-Type](message-body.md#wire-type), and the 4 remaining bits indicates the [Field Identifier](../definitions.md#field-identifier). This schema is described below:

```
[1-bit][4-bit field identifier][3-bit with wire type] 
```

For example, a key with a wire-type (0) and a field identifier (1) would be encoded as the following:

```
[0][0001][000] 
```

The following wire types are supported by default inside IOTMP:&#x20;

### Wire Type

The wire type specifies the format used for encoding each data field. IOTMP relies on JSON format or its derivates, so, different JSON encoding formats can be supported on an IOTMP server, i.e., PSON, MessagePack, CBOR, etc., so, different client implementations can choose the preferred encoding format, according to their needs, library availability, etc. It is preferred JSON binary representations, like PSON or MessagePack, as they can be used to send binary data, which can be required by some services provided over IOTMP.

By default, IOTMP supports 3 wire types:

* Varint: Indicates that the field holds an integer. It is heavily used in the protocol for specifying fields like the stream identifier.
* Self-contained: Indicates that the field holds a binary representation that can be decoded without additional information like total buffer size.
* Length-Delimited: Indicates that the field holds an arbitrary data representation that may require to know the total buffer size before its decoding.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is preferred to use self-contained encoding when possible, as it can save some bandwidth on each field.
{% endhint %}

### Field Identifier

The field identifier depends on each message, so, each one specifies their own message identifiers, as described [here](../messages/).

## Value

Each field with a key has an associated value that can be encoded in different formats, according to the specification provided on the [Wire-Type](message-body.md#wire-type).
